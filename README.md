# reMap: Spatially-Grounded Semantic Representation for Robots

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache_2-blue.svg) ![ROS2](https://img.shields.io/badge/ROS2-compatible-green.svg)  

## Overview

**reMap** is an open-source framework designed to enable robots to represent and interact with **spatially-grounded semantics**. It integrates both spatial and symbolic data to facilitate human-robot interaction (HRI) in dynamic environments. The system leverages a **VDB grid** to efficiently store and manage semantic entities and their spatial relationships.

This project is implemented as a **ROS 2-based package**, allowing seamless integration into modern robotic applications. It supports querying through **SPARQL-based semantic web APIs**, making it highly adaptable to various knowledge representation frameworks.

## Features

- **Voxel-based spatial representation**: Efficient handling of sparse and dynamic 3D information.
- **Semantic integration**: Links spatial data to symbolic concepts in an RDF-based knowledge base.
- **Modular ROS 2 architecture**: Includes plugins to process different types of semantic data.
- **Real-time querying**: Enables retrieval of spatially-grounded information via SPARQL.
- **Extensible framework**: Designed for easy adaptation and expansion for diverse robotic applications.
